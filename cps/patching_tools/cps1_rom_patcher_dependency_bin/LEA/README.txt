   - In the System Properties window, click 'Advanced system settings' on the left.
   - In the dialog that appears, click 'Environment Variables...' at the bottom right.
   - In the 'User variables for (name)' list, highlight 'Path', and click 'Edit'.
   - In the 'Edit User Variable' dialog, click in the 'Variable value' field and press End on your keyboard.
   - If the last character is not a semicolon, enter one.
   - Enter the full path of the folder containing Lea.exe, for example: C:\Program Files\Lea
   - Click OK on each open dialog to close them all.
